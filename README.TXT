FINAL IMAGE IS IN IMAGES

	For my collage, I took a picture of my friend during the solar eclipse and made 6 different changes to it. In the first image, I simple copied the original photo onto the coordinates (0,0). In my copy method I had an additional set of parameters that took the x and y coordinates and set them as the target x and y positions in the canvas. For the next modification, I made a recursive method where I recursively called the method recursive and divided the image into half the size over and over until the desired size. I made the images smaller and smaller by increasing the divide variable by one every time the method was recursively called. For my second modification I inverted the colors by subtracting the rgb values by 255 and setting them as the new colors. For my third modification, I converted the image into grayscale by taking the average of the rgb values and setting all the rgb values as the average. For my fourth modification I mirrored the photo over a vertical line and for my fifth modification I mirrored the photo over a horizontal line. For my last modification, I rotated the image 90 degrees. I rotated the image by taking the x coordinate of desired pixel in the original pixel and setting it as the y coordinate in the canvas and setting the y coordinate of the original as the x coordinate in the canvas.
